                <p>Name: Sultan Sadaqat<p>

                <p> 
                    I'm a Software Engineering student at "Centennial College". I was born in Ontario, Canada where I currently reside. <br>
                    I am currently in my second year of Software Engineering where I have been learning new programming skills frequently.  <br>
                    Some of my personal interests include: <br>
                    - Cars & Racing (Motorsport) <br>
                    - Cooking <br>
                    - Music <br>
                    - Gaming <br>
                    I live my life 4 tyres at a time. I am a hardcore racing enthusiast which you'll find essential to my personality. <br>
                    It would be a dream of mine to combine my innovative programming ideas with modern motorsport advancements.
